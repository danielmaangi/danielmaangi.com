## About Me

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Daniel, a passionate data scientist and analytics engineer with a deep-seated interest in leveraging data to drive social impact. Over the years, I've honed my skills in data science, analytics, and AI, and I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and insights with you.

### Who I Am

I’m a seasoned data scientist with a rich background in statistics and machine learning. My work has always been inspired by a desire to help organizations solve their most pressing problems and drive meaningful change by leveraging on their data assets. As an avid learner, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge and expertise in data science, engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
